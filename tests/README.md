# Testing

Tests are executed if they are in this directory or if they are within the source tree.

This means that whichever organization you prefer the configuration will handle it.

If the tests are included in the source tree they will not be copied over to the distribution directory.

Jest is the included testing framework. There is also a vscode launch profile for debugging the tests.
